# Play Squared Backend
-----------
## Overview
-----------
The project is a website that carries multiple browser-based  games that all function on a single square board. You can increase your board size to smaller or larger to make the gaming experience easier or more challenging.

Full CRUD was achieved using DJango and user authentication is a couple steps away from being fully functional. There are routes to view all game recommendations, view a specific game recommendation with options did edit and delete, and a route that portrays the score for the leaderboard.
